    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook we turn our attention from the design and creation of financial instrument objects  (eg bonds and bills) to the construction of a simple zero curve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A zero curve is a collection of dates and discount factors which collectively describe the term structure of interest rates through time and permit us to discount future cashflows to today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a zero curve enable us to perform valuation and other calcualations in relation to financial instruments and cashflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Zero Rates**: Interest rates for zero-coupon bonds of different maturities\n",
    "- **Discount Factors**: Present values of 1 unit of currency paid at future dates\n",
    "- **Exponential Interpolation**: A method for estimating rates between known points on the curve\n",
    "- **Amount at Maturity (AtMat)**: Future value based on zero rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "The notebook uses standard Python libraries for mathematical operations and data manipulation:\n",
    "- **math**: For basic mathematical operations (exponential, logarithm functions)\n",
    "- **numpy**: For numerical computations and array operations\n",

    "# The ZeroCurve Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can work with zero curves, we need to define the `ZeroCurve` class. This class is a simple collection of dates and discount factors which provides an ability to do NPV calculations as well as report rates and factors implied by the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ZeroCurve` class maintains four parallel lists to represent the yield curve:\n",
    "- **maturities**: Time points (in years) where we have rate information\n",
    "- **zero_rates**: Continuously compounded zero rates at each maturity\n",
    "- **AtMats**: Amount at maturity values (future values of $1 invested at time 0)\n",
    "- **discount_factors**: Present values of $1 received at each maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **add_zero_rate(maturity, zero_rate)**: Add a point to the curve using a zero rate\n",
    "2. **add_discount_factor(maturity, discount_factor)**: Add a point to the curve using a discount factor\n",
    "3. **get_zero_rate(maturity)**: Retrieve the zero rate for any maturity (with interpolation)\n",
    "4. **get_discount_factor(maturity)**: Retrieve the discount factor for any maturity (with interpolation)\n",
    "5. **get_AtMat(maturity)**: Retrieve the amount at maturity for any time point\n",
    "6. **npv(cash_flows)**: Calculate the net present value of a cash flow stream\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Interpolation Helper Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The class uses a \"helper\" or \"utility\" function (the `exp_interp` function) to do exponential interpolation in order to estimate values for maturities that don't exactly match stored points. This ensures that rates interpolate smoothly and maintain the no-arbitrage property of continuously compounded rates."

    "- `Bank_bill` objects\n",
    "- `Bond` objects  \n",
    "- `Portfolio` objects containing multiple instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "The `npv()` method doesn't need to know what specific type of object it's receiving. It only needs to know that the object implements the required interface:\n",
    "- A `get_maturities()` method that returns a list of time points\n",
    "- A `get_cash_flow(maturity)` method that returns the cash flow amount at a given time\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of polymorphism: writing code once that can work with many different types of objects, as long as they share a common interface. The same method call (`zc.npv(object)`) produces correct results whether we're valuing a simple cash flow stream or a complex portfolio of bonds and bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Polymorphism:**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: New instrument types can be added without modifying the `ZeroCurve` class\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The same valuation logic works for all current and future instrument types\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Changes to valuation logic only need to be made in one place\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Any new class that implements `get_maturities()` and `get_cash_flow()` can be valued automatically\n",
