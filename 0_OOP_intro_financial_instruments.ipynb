    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which are data structures that contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data** (called attributes or properties)\n",
    "2. **Code** (called methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of OOP is to build software in a way that reflects the real world.  So think of objects as software representations of things from the real world. A bond is a real world thing that has characteristics (face value, maturity, coupon rate) and behaviors (ways to calculate price and generate cash flows). In OOP, we embed these characteristics and behaviours into software objects that represent and \"encapsulate\" bonds."

    "## Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the key OOP concepts we've covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**\n",
    "   - `CashFlows`, `Bank_bill`, and `Bond` are classes (blueprints)\n",
    "   - `my_cash_flows`, `bill`, and `bond` are objects (instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes**\n",
    "   - Data stored in objects: `maturities`, `amounts`, `face_value`, `maturity`, `coupon`, `price`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods**\n",
    "   - Functions attached to objects: `add_cash_flow()`, `get_cash_flows()`, `set_ytm()`, `set_price()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "   - Data and methods are bundled together in classes\n",
    "   - Internal data is accessed through methods, not directly\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Abstraction**\n",
    "   - Complex functionality is hidden behind simple interfaces\n",
    "   - Users don't need to know how methods work internally, just how to use them\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inheritance**\n",
    "   - `Bank_bill` and `Bond` inherit attributes and methods from `CashFlows`\n",
    "   - Child classes can add new attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "   - `set_cash_flows()` behaves differently depending on the instrument type\n",
    "   - We can treat different instruments uniformly through their common interface"

    "Object-Oriented Programming helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organize code** around financial concepts (bonds, bills, portfolios)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reuse code** through inheritance (bonds and bills inherit cash flow management)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hide complexity** through encapsulation (don't need to know the internal pricing formulas)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Work with simple interfaces** through abstraction (interact with objects without understanding their internal implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model relationships** between entities (portfolios contain instruments)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Build maintainable systems** that can grow (easily add new instrument types like swaps, options, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Work with uniform interfaces** through polymorphism (all instruments can generate cash flows and calculate prices)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you practice OOP more, you'll develop an intuition for when and how to create classes to model financial problems. The same principles we used for bonds and bills apply to more complex instruments and systems!"
